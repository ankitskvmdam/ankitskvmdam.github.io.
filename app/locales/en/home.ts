    "Hey ðŸ‘‹, so glad you're here.<1 /><1 />A little about me, I'm a <0>Co-Founder</0>, <0>Software Engineer</0>, <0>UI/UX Designer</0>, and <0>Mentor</0>â€”crafting  tools people enjoy, writing thoughtful, maintainable code, and helping others grow with me.<1 /><1 />And most importantly, I'm rooted in Nalanda, Bihar (India).",
  about_me: `
  <0>Well</0>, here goesâ€”telling my story is never easy, especially the professional part. But I'll give it a shot.<1 /><1 />
My journey began in 2017, when I co-founded <0>Asaan Contracts Private Limited</0> with my brothers and close friends.
Our mission was simple: to make life easier for small and medium business owners through technology.
At Asaan, we built numerous proof-of-concepts aimed at codifying everyday business processes.
Looking back, that chapter was foundationalâ€”it gave me the chance to explore, experiment, and grow. <1 /><1 />

I'm not one to lieâ€”when we started, we were complete beginners, figuring things out as we went. But what we lacked in experience,
we made up for in passion and resilience. Limited resources meant wearing many hats. I primarily took on the
role of Lead Frontend Engineerâ€”architecting dashboards, defining design and coding guidelines, and creating
branding assets. It was intense, chaotic, and honestly... a lot of fun. <1 /><1 />

After Asaan and completing my undergraduate degree, I moved to the UK and joined a small lab at the <0>University of Cambridge</0>
as a Research Software Engineer. The team was incredibly skilled and deeply rooted in academic research. I worked mainly on
building a dashboard for a cloud-based tool, and also led the redesign of the lab's website and logo. It was a completely
different rhythm compared to a startupâ€”slower in some ways, more deliberate in others. I gained a new appreciation for how
academic environments function, and the unique challenges they bring. <1 /><1 />

From there, I moved to Japan, where I joined <0>Startbahn</0>, a startup focused on building blockchain infrastructure for the creative industries.
It was a short but eye-opening experience. I rewrote their component library, led a major refactor of their legacy core platform,
and helped create internal coding guidelines and best practices. One thing that stood out: the discipline. Even in a small team,
documentation was taken seriously, and the feedback I received on my guidelines helped me become a better communicator and a more
thoughtful developer. <1 /><1 />

Then came summer 2023â€”and a new chapter with <0>Bodygram</0>, where I joined as a Software Engineer. Bodygram is on a mission to help businesses
tap into the power of body measurement data. It's something we all have, but most of us don't realize how valuable it can beâ€”from fashion
and fitness to healthcare and even choosing the perfect mattress. At Bodygram, I worked on enhancing the core scanning logic, building
dashboards to manage scan results, developing SDKs to help clients integrate scan widgets, and creating components for embedding 3D avatar
viewers. <1 /><1 />

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open source projectsâ€”it's my way of giving back, learning, and staying connected with
the wider dev community. <1 /><1 />

And thatâ€™s my professional journeyâ€”so far. It's just the beginning, and I'm sure I'll have even better stories to share
when we meet in person. Thanks for reading.
